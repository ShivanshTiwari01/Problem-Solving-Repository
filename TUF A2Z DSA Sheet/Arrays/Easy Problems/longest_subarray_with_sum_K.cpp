// Program: Find the Longest subarray with given sum K.

// Approach one: Using Hash Map this approach works for positive and negatives both. Best approach for arrays containing positve, zeroes and negatives.


// Approach two: Using Two pointer, this approach works only for positives including zeroes, but is more optimised approach.
// Best approach for arrays containing only positives and zeroes.
